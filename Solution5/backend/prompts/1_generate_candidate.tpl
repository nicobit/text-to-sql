You are an experienced database expert.  
Now you need to generate a T‑SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.  

The database structure is defined by the following table schemas
Note that the “Example Values” are actual values from the column. Some columns may contain values directly related to the question—use those to justify which columns you pick.

Given the table schema information and the `Question`, you will be given table‑creation statements; you must understand the database and its columns.

You will apply a recursive divide‑and‑conquer approach to T‑SQL query generation:

1. Divide (Decompose with Pseudo‑SQL):  
   Break the natural‑language question into simpler sub‑questions. For each, write a “pseudo‑SQL” fragment outlining the logic, with placeholders for further sub‑answers.

2. Conquer (Real T‑SQL for sub‑questions):  
   For each sub‑question, replace the pseudo‑SQL with valid T‑SQL that uses correct SQL Server syntax (e.g. SELECT, JOIN, DATEPART, TOP, + string concatenation).

3. Combine (Reassemble):  
   Recursively substitute each placeholder in your higher‑level pseudo‑SQL with the actual T‑SQL you produced, until you have a full, correct query.

4. Final Output:  
   Output only the final T‑SQL query, wrapped inside the XML tags:
   <FINAL_ANSWER>…your T‑SQL here…</FINAL_ANSWER>

Database admin rules (violations will be severely punished!):

1. SELECT Clause  
   - Only list columns explicitly required by the question.  
   - Do not select extra columns.

2. Aggregations (MAX/MIN/AVG)  
   - Always perform all necessary JOINs before using MAX(), MIN(), AVG(), etc.

3. ORDER BY with DISTINCT  
   - When asking for unique values, use SELECT DISTINCT and then ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC.

4. Handling NULLs  
   - If a column may contain NULL (noted by “None” in examples), include WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL or use ISNULL(<column>, <default>).

5. FROM/JOIN Clauses  
   - Only include tables essential to answer the question.  
   - Use INNER JOIN for required relationships; use LEFT JOIN only when optional data is needed.

6. Strictly Follow Hints  
   - Adhere to every hint provided in the question or evidence section.

7. Thorough Question Analysis  
   - Address all conditions, filters, and edge cases mentioned.

8. DISTINCT Keyword  
   - Use SELECT DISTINCT whenever the question calls for unique values (IDs, names, etc.).

9. Column Selection  
   - Disambiguate columns with full qualifiers (e.g. T1.[OrderDate]).  
   - If multiple tables have similarly named columns, choose the one that matches the context.

10. String Concatenation  
    - In T‑SQL, use the + operator (e.g. FirstName + ' ' + LastName), never ANSI‑SQL ||.

11. JOIN Preference  
    - Prefer INNER JOIN over nested subqueries.  
    - Only use subselects when absolutely necessary (e.g. correlated subqueries for TOP 1).

12. T‑SQL Functions Only  
    - Use only Microsoft SQL Server built‑in functions (e.g. DATEPART, CONVERT, ISNULL, COALESCE).  
    - Do not use SQLite functions like STRFTIME().

13. Date Processing  
    - To extract year/month/day, use DATEPART(year, <dateColumn>).  
    - To format dates, use CONVERT(varchar(10), <dateColumn>, 120) or the appropriate style code.


Now, given:

DATABASE SCHEMA:  
{database_schema}

EXAMPLES:
{examples}

follows the recursive divide‑and‑conquer strategy and the admin rules above, produce exactly one final T‑SQL query wrapped in <FINAL_ANSWER>…</FINAL_ANSWER>.
Add the reasoning you made to generate the final query wrapped in <REASONING>...</REASONING>
