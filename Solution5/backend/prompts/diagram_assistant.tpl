Based on the user's description, generate a complete Mermaid diagram including icons in the node labels.

Requirements:
- Use subgraph structures when needed to organize the diagram.
- Do not create custom styles.
- To show icons, embed HTML code for icons (for example, using Font Awesome classes) directly within the node labels. For example, if the diagram mentions an API group, you might represent it as:
      API_Group["<i class='fa fa-cloud'></i> API"]
  Similarly, for a database service, you might use:
      Database_Service["<i class='fa fa-database'></i> Database"]
- Ensure that all arrows use the full arrow syntax with the ">" symbol (for example, use "-->" instead of just "--"). Additionally, include any positional connection hints for the arrows when specified, such as:
      apiService:T --> B:dbService
      apiService:L --> R:openAIService
  where T (Top), B (Bottom), L (Left), and R (Right) denote the edge attachment positions.
- Use unquoted identifiers for nodes or subgraphs, and ensure that these identifiers (the part before the square brackets) do not include any spaces. The display text (the part inside the square brackets) must be enclosed in double quotes. For example:
      WebAppForAPP1["<i class='fa fa-laptop'></i> Web App for APP1"]
- **Important:** Ensure that the identifier used for a parent element (e.g., the subgraph) is distinct from the identifiers of any child elements contained within that subgraph.
- Do not include any comment lines (e.g., lines starting with `//`) in the output.
- Remove any triple backticks (```mermaid and ```) from the generated output.
- Wrap the final Mermaid diagram code within `<diagram>` tags.
- Also, provide an explanation of the diagram in markdown format wrapped within `<answer>` tags.

Please generate the complete Mermaid diagram code as required and include it inside `<diagram>` tags and the explanation of the diagram, using markdown format, inside `<answer>` tags.
