Here’s a set of **20 challenging, high‑coverage natural‑language questions** you can use to test an NL‑to‑SQL system against the **AdventureWorks** schema. These span aggregations, windowing, subqueries, analytics, and edge cases common in OLTP databases.

> **Summary:** You’ll find questions that exercise joins across multiple schemas, grouping and aggregation, window functions, correlated subqueries, date‑based filters, conditional logic, and existence/anti‑existence checks. Running your NL‑to‑SQL pipeline on these will surface whether it can handle real‑world complexity in the AdventureWorks sample database.

## Correlated and anti‑existence patterns

16. **Suppliers of high‑cost parts**  
    “Identify vendors who supply parts with a standard cost above $1,000.” 
17. **Branches missing orders**  
    “Which sales territories have no orders in the past quarter?”

Each question here leverages key AdventureWorks tables—**Sales.SalesOrderHeader**, **Sales.SalesOrderDetail**, **Production.Product**, **HumanResources.Employee**, **HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory**, **Person.Person**, **Purchasing.Vendor**, **Sales.Customer**, etc.—and pushes an NL‑to‑SQL system through typical real‑world query complexities. 

**To validate**: feed these as natural‑language inputs to your pipeline and verify the generated T‑SQL against manually written solutions. The breadth of topics (aggregates, windowing, subqueries, dates, existence) ensures a comprehensive test.
