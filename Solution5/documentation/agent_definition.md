An ideal Agent base class should include the following core components:

1. **Initialization and Configuration:**  
   - **Agent Identity:** Attributes such as the agent's name and the specific task it is designed to accomplish.
   - **Configuration Settings:** A configuration dictionary that includes details like available tools and any engine or runtime settings.
   - **Tools Management:** A way to store and access the tools (e.g., through a dictionary) that the agent can call during its operation.
   - **Chat History:** A mechanism (like a list) to maintain a log of interactions and context over the conversation.

2. **Core Processing Method:**  
   - **Workout or Process Method:** A primary method (often named something like `workout`) that:
     - Prepares and issues an initial system prompt.
     - Iteratively interacts with the language model (agent) to decide on next actions.
     - Determines when the process should stop (e.g., checking for a “DONE” signal).
     - Manages the sequence of tool calls based on agent responses.

3. **Language Model Interaction:**  
   - **Call Agent Method:** A function to construct a message from the chat history, query the language model, and return its response.
   - **Prompt Preparation:** Use of prompt templates and formatting (e.g., including the agent’s name, task, and available tools).

4. **Tool Integration:**  
   - **Call Tool Method:** A function that allows the agent to invoke an external tool, passing the current system state and handling any exceptions that might occur.
   - **Tool Description Generator:** A helper method that compiles a human-readable list of available tools, often used to inform the language model or for debugging purposes.

5. **Response Parsing and Decision Making:**  
   - **Is Done Check:** A method to determine whether the agent’s output indicates that no further actions are necessary.
   - **Extracting Next Action:** A method to parse the language model’s output (for example, extracting a tool name from specific markers like `<tool_call>...</tool_call>`) and validate that the tool exists.

6. **Callable Interface:**  
   - **Magic Method `__call__`:** Implementing the `__call__` method to allow an instance of the agent to be invoked directly with a system state, effectively acting as a function.

7. **Error Handling:**  
   - **Robust Exception Management:** Try-except blocks around critical operations (e.g., tool calls and agent responses) to handle unexpected failures gracefully and provide useful error messages.

These components ensure that the Agent base class is flexible, modular, and capable of iteratively processing a system state by combining the reasoning power of a language model with the utility of external tools.
