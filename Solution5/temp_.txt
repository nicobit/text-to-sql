For product & stakeholders





Business context and decisions live in Confluence → source of truth for product requirements.
Policies, templates, and org-wide docs live in SharePoint.
This site focuses on technical implementation, roadmap sync, and operational runbooks.

# Minimal CSS polish (optional)



Create `docs/styles/extra.css` and add to `mkdocs.yml`:



```yaml

extra_css:

  - styles/extra.css

/* Slightly larger hero like ai.azure.com */

.md-main__inner > .md-content { padding-top: 0; }

.badges img { margin-right: .5rem; }

.grid.cards .md-button { margin-top: .4rem; }









Notes & tips





The landing page uses template: home.html with hero: and features: (supported in Material v9+).
Use Material icons like material-rocket-launch-outline. Full list: material/*.
The grid cards block uses simple Markdown + classes (grid cards)—works with the extensions configured above.
Keep Roadmap auto-generated by your GitLab pipeline; link it from the home.
Split audiences: Devs (this site) vs. Product/Org (Confluence/SharePoint). Cross-link, don’t duplicate.




If you want, I can tailor the copy and navigation to your exact project names and wire the roadmap pages to your GitLab milestones job you already run.
