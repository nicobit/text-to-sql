# Release Management Strategy
### Agile Weekly Minor Releases & Quarterly Major Releases  
**Model:** Release Flow Branching Strategy  
**Environments:** DEV ‚Üí AIT ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí PRE-PROD ‚Üí PROD  
**Governance:** CAB submission Monday ‚Üí Deployment Friday

---

## üéØ Objective
Deliver high-quality features and fixes **frequently and safely**, ensuring:
- One **minor release per week** (small stories, bug fixes, configuration changes).
- Two **major releases per quarter** (epics, architecture, data model updates).
- Full control through **CAB submission, test validation, and traceable promotion** across environments.
- **Continuous development** on `main`, while each release candidate is **frozen, validated, and auditable**.

---

## üß© Dual Environment Model ‚Äî Minor vs Major Releases

To support **weekly minor releases** and **quarterly major releases** in parallel, maintain **two environment lines**:

| Line | Purpose | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Minor Release Line** | Continuous weekly delivery | Normal Release Flow through DEV ‚Üí AIT ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí PRE-PROD ‚Üí PROD |
| **Major Release Line** | Long-term validation for big upgrades | Parallel DEV-Major ‚Üí AIT-Major ‚Üí UAT-Major ‚Üí PRE-PROD-Major ‚Üí same PROD |

### Architecture Overview

      A2 --> A3[UAT-Minor]
      A3 --> A4[PRE-PROD-Minor]
      A4 --> PROD[PRODUCTION]
    end

    subgraph LINE_B[Quarterly Major Release Line]

      B1 --> B2[AIT-Major]
      B2 --> B3[UAT-Major]
      B3 --> B4[PRE-PROD-Major]
      B4 --> PROD
    end

    A1 -. parallel development .-> B1
    PROD -->|Same live target| MON[Monitoring & Feedback]
```

### Benefits of Two Environment Lines
| Benefit | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **No delivery blockage** | Minor weekly releases continue while major testing runs. |
| **Reduced CAB conflict** | Separate CAB submissions and evidence. |
| **Dedicated regression capacity** | Major track performs long regressions without delaying weekly deliveries. |
| **Shared PROD** | One production environment simplifies monitoring and release cadence. |
| **Shared DEV** | Developers can contribute to both trains efficiently. |

## üîß How the Lines Work Together
1. **Minor releases** use `main` and weekly `release/YYYY.MM.DD` branches.  
2. **Major release** (e.g., `release/v3.0`) evolves in parallel with its own testing environments.  
3. Before go-live:
   - Minor releases pause for 1‚Äì2 weeks.
   - Final UAT + PRE-PROD validation on major track.
   - CAB approves the major deployment window.
4. After go-live:
   - Merge the major branch back into `main`.
   - Resume weekly release cadence.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Recommendations
- Maintain **two environment lines**: one for **weekly minor**, one for **quarterly major** releases.
- Use **shared DEV and PROD**, separate **AIT, UAT, PRE-PROD**.
- Keep **synchronized data** between pre-prod environments.
- Align CAB approvals to avoid overlaps.
- Major release CAB includes rollback & comms plan.

---

## üìò Summary
This dual-line approach enables:
- Continuous weekly value delivery.
- Long-running validation for major changes.
- Separate testing tracks, shared production.
- Lower risk, higher speed, clear governance.

# Operational Release Management Strategy

This document provides a complete operational framework for managing software releases across multiple environments using two parallel release lines: **Major** and **Minor**. It defines cadence, environment flow, branching model, testing stages, governance, rollback, and communication procedures.

---

## 1. Release Cadence and Definition

| Release Type | Frequency | Purpose | Example Version |
|---------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Minor Release** | Weekly | Delivery of incremental features, fixes, and patches | `v2.4.1` |
| **Major Release** | Quarterly | Delivery of structural changes, new modules, architecture upgrades | `v3.0.0` |

### 1.1 Objectives

- Ensure stability in production through predictable, tested deployments.
- Allow continuous delivery without blocking long-term development.
- Maintain quality assurance gates for each line independently.

---

## 2. Environment Model ‚Äî Two Parallel Lines

To support stability and innovation simultaneously, two environment lines are maintained:

- **Line A (Major Release Line):** used for large-scale changes, long QA cycles, and architecture upgrades.  
- **Line B (Minor Release Line):** used for weekly feature releases and fixes.

### 2.1 Environment Flow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Major_Line ["Major Release Line"]
        DEV_M[Dev - Major] --> TEST_M[Test - Major]
        TEST_M --> PREPROD_M[PreProd - Major]
        PREPROD_M --> PROD_M[Prod - Major]
    end

    subgraph Minor_Line ["Minor Release Line"]
        DEV_m[Dev - Minor] --> TEST_m[Test - Minor]
        TEST_m --> PREPROD_m[PreProd - Minor]
        PREPROD_m --> PROD_m[Prod - Minor]
    end

    PROD_M -.->|Merge alignment| DEV_m
```

### 2.2 Environment Responsibilities

| Environment | Purpose | Owner | Notes |
|--------------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Dev** | Early integration, developer testing | Development Team | CI build validation |
| **Test** | QA functional and regression testing | QA Team | Automated + manual tests |
| **PreProd** | Final validation with production-like data | Release Management | Sanity, performance, UAT |
| **Prod** | Live environment | Ops / SRE | Final monitored deployment |

---

## 3. Branching Strategy

The branching model ensures clear isolation between feature development, minor updates, and major releases.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "main"
    branch develop
    commit id: "Initial setup"
    branch release/v3.0.0
    commit id: "Major work"
    checkout develop
    branch release/v2.5.x
    commit id: "Minor work"
    checkout develop
    branch feature/abc
    commit id: "Feature"
    checkout release/v2.5.x
    merge feature/abc
    checkout main
    merge release/v2.5.x
    merge release/v3.0.0
```

### 3.1 Branch Types

| Branch | Purpose | Merge Target |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **main** | Production-ready code | ‚Äî |
| **develop** | Active development for upcoming minor releases | `release/vX.Y.x` |
| **release/vX.Y.x** | Stabilization branch for a specific release | `main` |
| **feature/** | New features or fixes | `develop` |
| **hotfix/** | Urgent fixes for production | `main` and back-merged to `develop` |
| **major/** | Structural changes for next quarterly release | `release/vX+1.0.0` |

### 3.2 Rules

- Feature branches must merge into `develop` only after successful pipeline checks.  
- Minor releases are tagged weekly from the latest stable release branch.  
- Major releases are branched from `main` quarterly.  
- Merge conflicts between major and minor lines are resolved during synchronization windows.  

---

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

| Stage | Responsibility | Test Type | Automation |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Dev** | Developers | Unit Tests | ‚úÖ |
| **Test** | QA Team | Integration, Regression | ‚úÖ |
| **PreProd** | Release Team | UAT, Performance | ‚öôÔ∏è Partial |
| **Prod** | Ops/SRE | Smoke, Monitoring Validation | ‚úÖ |

### 4.1 Quality Gates

- Static code analysis (SonarQube, linting)
- Vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Trivy)
- Automated test pass ‚â• 90%
- Performance threshold deviation < 10%
- Security approval prior to promotion

---

## 5. Promotion and Deployment Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev
    participant QA
    participant RM as Release Manager
    participant OPS

    Dev->>QA: Push build to Test (weekly minor)
    QA->>RM: Validate test results
    RM->>OPS: Approve for PreProd
    OPS->>OPS: Deploy to PreProd
    OPS->>RM: Confirm validation
    RM->>OPS: Deploy to Prod
```

- All deployments follow automated pipelines (CI/CD).  
- Approvals required for promotion between stages.  
- Deployment artifacts versioned and immutable.  

---

## 6. Rollback and Contingency

- **Automated rollback:** via deployment history (e.g., Helm rollback, GitLab environments).  
- **Manual rollback:** follow change management procedure.  
- **Root cause analysis:** mandatory for all failed deployments.  
- **Rollback testing:** quarterly simulation to ensure process readiness.

---

## 7. Governance and Communication

| Phase | Communication Channel | Owner | Artifacts |
|--------|------------------------|--------|------------|
| Pre-Release | Confluence / Teams | Release Manager | Release Notes |
| Post-Deployment | Email / ChatOps | Ops Team | Incident Summary |
| Quarterly Planning | Management Review | PMO | Roadmap, KPIs |

---

## 8. Timeline Overview

```mermaid
gantt
    title Release Calendar (Major vs Minor)
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Minor Releases (Weekly)
    Week_1 :done, 2025-01-06, 7d
    Week_2 :done, 2025-01-13, 7d
    Week_3 :active, 2025-01-20, 7d
    Week_4 : 2025-01-27, 7d

    section Major Releases (Quarterly)
    Q1_Release :done, 2025-03-31, 14d
    Q2_Release :active, 2025-06-30, 14d
    Q3_Release : 2025-09-30, 14d
    Q4_Release : 2025-12-31, 14d
```

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement

- Conduct release retrospectives after every major deployment.  
- Review and update branching rules quarterly.  
- Automate regression tests and performance benchmarks continuously.  
- Maintain feedback loop from users to prioritize post-release fixes.

---

## 10. Summary

This strategy balances **speed and stability** by separating release lines, enforcing structured branching, and ensuring strong QA governance. It supports continuous delivery for weekly improvements while enabling predictable quarterly milestones for major evolution.
